    <h4> ABOUT ME </h4>
    <hr />
    <p> In my spare time I break do two main activities: working out and playing video games. </p>
    <p> I do workout my overall body however, I play several games: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Rainbow Six: Siege </li>
      <li> Valorant </li>
      <li> Aimlabs </li>
    </ul>
    <p> My favorite parts <em>(in order)</em> of my upper body to workout are: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Bicep </li>
      <li> Back </li>
      <li> Lats </li>
      <li> Forearm/Finger Strength </li>
      <li> Core/Abs </li>
      <li> Others <em>(random & unchronological)</em>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I randomly sometimes play sports/activities: <em>(usually after school/on weekends) </em>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Volleyball</li>
      <li>Cycling</li>
      <li>Helping out my Dad</li>
      <li>Doing chores</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As I play several video games, even more that are not listed above, my main game is <strong>Rainbow Six: Siege</strong>. </p>
    <hr />
    <h4> WHY RAINBOW SIX: SIEGE?</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>It's important to understand, everybody has their favorite games, and a well-documented portion of those people also like to play with their friends. <em>R6</em> for me is a game I can play alone and with friends. </p>
    <p> I find the game fascinating enough, it is difficult to explain the complex nature of my liking to this game. </p>
